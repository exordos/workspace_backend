Status: the target specification of the operation, first developed in the documentation.
remains unchanged and is the normative [`workspace_api.md`](../../../../workspace_api.md).
This file describes the transaction and projection target boundaries; it doesn ' t
production code, migration SQL or new endpoint.

## Purpose and public contract

Get one visible metadata entry from the file.

Authentication: Bearer IAM; `project_id` and current `user_uuid` tokens are taken from context IAM.

## Path and query settings

| Location | Name of the person | Type / rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The way | `file_uuid` | UUID |

The collection pagination, where it is provided, preserves the current contract `page_limit` and UUID
`page_marker` and returns `X-Pagination-Limit`, and
`X-Pagination-Marker` Only if there 's a next page ..

## The body of the query

The body of the query is missing.

## A Successful Answer

`200`

```json
{
  "uuid": "f11353e0-712d-4b99-a716-5cdba848cc05",
  "user_uuid": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
  "stream_uuid": "75309057-419c-4b12-a7c1-3932429ec4a6",
  "name": "example.txt",
  "description": "Example",
  "content_type": "text/plain",
  "size_bytes": 12,
  "hash": "abc",
  "created_at": "2026-07-17T08:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-17T08:00:00Z"
}
```



## Errors and authorization

Incorrect filters return HTTP `400`; unavailable single resource returns not found. Errors IAM pass through the common authentication error boundary Workspace.

General form of response for validation error:

```json
{
  "type": "ValidationErrorException",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Validation error occurred."
}
```

## The target boundary RestAlchemy

```python
from restalchemy.api import controllers as ra_controllers
from restalchemy.api import resources as ra_resources
from restalchemy.dm import models
from restalchemy.dm import properties
from restalchemy.dm import types
from restalchemy.storage.sql import orm


class WorkspaceFile(models.ModelWithUUID, models.ModelWithProject,
                    models.ModelWithTimestamp, orm.SQLStorableMixin):
    # Contract boundary only; target storage decomposition is not selected.
    __tablename__ = "m_workspace_files"
    user_uuid = properties.property(types.UUID(), required=True, read_only=True)
    stream_uuid = properties.property(types.AllowNone(types.UUID()))
    name = properties.property(types.String(max_length=255), required=True)
    description = properties.property(types.String(max_length=255), default="")
    content_type = properties.property(types.String(max_length=255), required=True)
    size_bytes = properties.property(types.Integer(min_value=0), required=True)
    hash = properties.property(types.String(max_length=255), required=True)


class WorkspaceFileController(ra_controllers.BaseResourceControllerPaginated):
    __resource__ = ra_resources.ResourceByRAModel(
        model_class=WorkspaceFile,
        hidden_fields=["project_id"],
        convert_underscore=False,
        process_filters=True,
    )
    # Narrow multipart/storage/download overrides preserve the current contract.
```

Each public reference to an entity is declared a scalar UUID property RestAlchemy, not `relationship` (which would be serialized as URI). The corresponding physical column `*_uuid`  an indexed external key with an explicitly selected reference action. Therefore, public JSON keeps UUID unchanged.

The current metadata/repository contract/ACL is preserved; the target physical breakdown is not selected.`project_id` remains hidden. The scalar `user_uuid` and the permissive `null` `stream_uuid` remain public UUID values supported by indexed FKs. Dynamic access by membership in the stream is checked by the canonical bindings of the stream.

## Synchronous path API

1. Run the authentication.
2. Find the metadata by UUID.
3. Check the public ACL or current indexed stream binding.
4. Return the cleaned metadata line.

## Outbox, Typed tasks, worker and real-time work

This reading does not record a domain event or outbox record, does not create a typed projection task, and does not publish a public event. DB-based resources are read by indexes without computations. All counters are already materialized; the query does not execute `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, correlated subqueries, and does not scan message bindings.

The WebSocket controller is not involved.

## Idempotence, keys and races

The operation is safe to repeat because it does not change the state..

## The moment of visibility for the client

The client gets a fixed state available at the time of the read transaction; the request does not schedule a new deferred work.
